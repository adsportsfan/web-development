		<h1> TAILS: You lost the toss. You will be on defense first. </h1>
		<p>
			Our job is to prevent the offense from scoring a touchdown to win the CSCI Super Bowl.

		<p>
			<!-- HTML table elements format text/images into rows and columns. -->
			For every play, we are just going to blitz the offense to try and recover the ball.
		</p>

		<p> We are going to continue to blitz until we recover the ball or the game is over. </p>
